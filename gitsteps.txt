STEP 1 git push and what happens
git push to my repo
""         warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
         Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
         and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

         git config --global push.default matching

         To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

         git config --global push.default simple

         When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
         to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

         Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
         behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
         remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

         See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
         (the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
         'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

         Username for 'https://github.com': ^C

So...
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
git status
""         On branch master
         Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
         Untracked files:
         (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

               .gitsteps.txt.kate-swp
               README
               gitsteps.txt

         nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
""
git add README
get add gitsteps.tst

git config --global core.editor kate

   c35fc14..73945e0  master -> master

   so make some changes and push again but it has to be staged "I assume"
   but I will try without first and just edit this and push
   
   I have to add this file and then push, but first I am going to config my name and password locally
   
   Now I am doing the SSH switch so I can avoid entering name and password every time
   
   Looks like it worked 
   a reference is::
   https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
   now to see if that works
