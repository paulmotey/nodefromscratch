STEP 1 git push and what happens
git push to my repo
""         warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
         Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
         and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

         git config --global push.default matching

         To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

         git config --global push.default simple

         When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
         to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

         Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
         behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
         remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

         See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
         (the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
         'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

         Username for 'https://github.com': ^C

So...
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
git status
""         On branch master
         Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
         Untracked files:
         (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

               .gitsteps.txt.kate-swp
               README
               gitsteps.txt

         nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
""
git add README
get add gitsteps.tst

git config --global core.editor kate

   so make some changes and push again but it has to be staged "I assume"
   but I will try without first and just edit this and push
   
   I have to add this file and then push, but first I am going to config my name and password locally
   
   Now I am doing the SSH switch so I can avoid entering name and password every time
   
   Looks like it worked 
   a reference is::
   https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
   now to see if that works
   So the SSH is setup and it works okay
Basically when a change is made in this file I do the following:
Where the name is probably optional for this but can tell somebody why I did that commit so to finish this part
and go on to establishing a framework for a node.js sails and express app I will close out this until new
information on using git needs to be documented.

   git add gitsteps.txt
   git commit -m "basic GIT push and ssh is understood"
   git push origin master

   cd ..
   git clone git@github.com:lukegeiken4/Hypeline.git
   
What is really odd is the asynchronous nature of things in node.js and mongoDB
I tried some actions and when I realized what was happening I had to laugh.
As somebody who started out writing programs in hexadecimal and making my own ALU,
I am well versed in the synchronous world and interrupts as well as CLI and STI
can be a real bear to deal with in an application.
node.js is like a herd of cats tring to catch mice and you really have
to bet that the cat is going to finally catch "some" mouse eventually
I am still laughing as it is such a wonderful thing to know as it
solves so many problems.
The brain acts "somewhat" like this and it will get in a mode,
but then it finds another node.

db.test_collection.find()
That is a good thing when running mongo to see what has been done to the base
